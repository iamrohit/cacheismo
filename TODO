1) document the lua API
2) support for noreply, incr, decr, stats, etc
3) some of the lua methods need to have return values
4) think about clustering. In the current form cacheismo cannot be used 
   in a cluster. Since key is used in deciding the server, virtual keys 
   can cause requests to go to a server which doesn't have the data. 
   Basically virtual key and actual key need not resolve to same server. 
   Similarly when multiple keys are used, the problem is compounded. May 
   be adding proxy/client functionality would help. Explore lua threads 
   and coroutines.
